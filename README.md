## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

```css
.panel {
  transition:
    font-size 0.7s cubic-bezier(0.61,-0.19, 0.7,-0.11),
    flex 0.7s cubic-bezier(0.61,-0.19, 0.7,-0.11),
    background 0.2s;
}
```
Currently practicing to get better in animation.

### Continued development

- CSS Animation specially cubic-bezier
- Which animation is supposed to be appropriate in which area

### Useful resources

- [Stunning Images](https://unsplash.com/) - I really like the quality and free access to beautiful images.
- [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This is an amazing place to find best fonts for your projects.
